# Master Thread States

This article documents thread states that are related to [replication](https://github.com/mariadb-corporation/docs-server/blob/test/server/ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/buffers-caches-and-threads/thread-states/broken-reference/README.md) master threads. These correspond to the `STATE` values listed by the [SHOW PROCESSLIST](../../../../reference/sql-statements/administrative-sql-statements/show/show-processlist.md) statement or in the [Information Schema PROCESSLIST Table](../../../../reference/system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-processlist-table.md) as well as the `PROCESSLIST_STATE` value listed in the [Performance Schema threads Table](../../../../reference/system-tables/performance-schema/performance-schema-tables/performance-schema-threads-table.md).
