# SHOW CREATE VIEW

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW CREATE VIEW [view-name]
```

## Description

This statement shows a [CREATE VIEW](../../../../server-usage/views/create-view.md) statement that creates the given [view](../../../../server-usage/views/), as well as the character set used by the connection when the view was created. This statement also works with views.

`SHOW CREATE VIEW` quotes table, column and stored function names according to the value of the [sql\_quote\_show\_create](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sql_quote_show_create) server system variable.

## Examples

```sql
SHOW CREATE VIEW example\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                View: example
         Create View: CREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED DEFINER=`root`@`localhost` SQL
SECURITY DEFINER VIEW `example` AS (select `t`.`id` AS `id`,`t`.`s` AS `s` from
`t`)
character_set_client: cp850
collation_connection: cp850_general_ci
```

With [sql\_quote\_show\_create](../../../../ha-and-performance/optimization-and-tuning/system-variables/server-system-variables.md#sql_quote_show_create) off:

```sql
SHOW CREATE VIEW example\G
*************************** 1. row ***************************
                View: example
         Create View: CREATE ALGORITHM=UNDEFINED DEFINER=root@localhost SQL SECU
RITY DEFINER VIEW example AS (select t.id AS id,t.s AS s from t)
character_set_client: cp850
collation_connection: cp850_general_ci
```

## Grants

To be able to see a view, you need to have the [SHOW VIEW](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#table-privileges) and the [SELECT](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#table-privileges) privilege on the view:

```sql
GRANT SHOW VIEW,SELECT ON test_database.test_view TO 'test'@'localhost';
```
