# SHOW TABLE STATUS

## Syntax

```sql
SHOW TABLE STATUS [{FROM | IN} db_name]
    [LIKE 'pattern' | WHERE expr]
```

## Description

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
`SHOW TABLE STATUS` works like [SHOW TABLES](show-tables.md), but provides more extensive information about each table.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 11.2.0" %}
`SHOW TABLE STATUS` works like [SHOW TABLES](show-tables.md), but provides more extensive information about each table. Only non-TEMPORARY tables are shown.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

The `LIKE` clause, if present on its own, indicates which table names to match. The `WHERE` and `LIKE` clauses can be given to select rows using more general conditions, as discussed in [Extended SHOW](extended-show.md).

The following information is returned:

| Create\_time       | Time the table was created. Some engines just return the ctime information from the file system layer here, in that case the value is not necessarily the table creation time but rather the time the file system metadata for it had last changed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Update\_time       | Time the table was last updated. On Windows, the timestamp is not updated on update, so MyISAM values will be inaccurate. In [InnoDB](../../../../server-usage/storage-engines/innodb/), if shared tablespaces are used, will be NULL, while buffering can also delay the update, so the value will differ from the actual time of the last UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Check\_time        | Time the table was last checked. Not kept by all storage engines, in which case will be NULL.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

From [MariaDB 11.2.0](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-11-2-series/mariadb-11-2-0-release-notes), will also be set to "Y" for local temporary tables. |

Similar information can be found in the [information\_schema.TABLES](../../../system-tables/information-schema/information-schema-tables/information-schema-tables-table.md) table as well as by using [mariadb-show](../../../../clients-and-utilities/administrative-tools/mariadb-show.md):

```bash
mariadb-show --status db_name
```

## Views

For views, all columns in `SHOW TABLE STATUS` are `NULL` except 'Name' and 'Comment'

## Example

```sql
SHOW TABLE STATUS\G
