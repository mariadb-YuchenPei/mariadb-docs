SHOW PRIVILEGES
```

## Description

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Current" %}
`SHOW PRIVILEGES` shows the list of [system privileges](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) that the MariaDB server supports. The exact list of privileges depends on the version of your server.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="< 10.5.2 / 10.4.13 / 10.3.23" %}
`SHOW PRIVILEGES` shows the list of [system privileges](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md) that the MariaDB server supports. The exact list of privileges depends on the version of your server.

Note that before [MariaDB 10.3.23](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-3-series/mariadb-10323-release-notes), [MariaDB 10.4.13](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/release-notes-mariadb-10-4-series/mariadb-10413-release-notes) and [MariaDB 10.5.2](https://app.gitbook.com/s/aEnK0ZXmUbJzqQrTjFyb/community-server/old-releases/mariadb-10-5-series/mariadb-1052-release-notes) , the [Delete history](../../account-management-sql-statements/grant.md#table-privileges) privilege displays as `Delete versioning rows` ([MDEV-20382](https://jira.mariadb.org/browse/MDEV-20382)).
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Example

{% hint style="info" %}
The output is for MariaDB version from 10.5.9. In previous versions, it might look differently.
