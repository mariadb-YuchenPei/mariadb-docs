# io\_by\_thread\_by\_latency and x$io\_by\_thread\_by\_latency Sys Schema Views

{% include "../../../../.gitbook/includes/sys-schema-views-are-availa....md" %}

## Description

The `io_by_thread_by_latency` and `x$io_by_thread_by_latency` view summarize I/O consumers to display time waiting for I/O, grouped by thread. Rows are sorted by descending total I/O latency by default.

The `io_by_thread_by_latency` view is intended to be easier for human reading, while the `x$io_by_thread_by_latency` view provides the data in raw form, intended for tools that process the data.

They contain the following columns:

| Column          | Description                                                                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| user            | The account associated with a foreground thread, or the background thread name |
| total           | Total number of I/O events allocated for the thread.                           |
| total\_latency  | Total wait time of timed I/O events for the thread.                            |
| min\_latency    | Minimum single wait time of timed I/O events for the thread.                   |
| avg\_latency    | Average wait time per timed I/O event for the thread.                          |
| min\_latency    | Maximum single wait time of timed I/O events for the thread.                   |
| thread\_id      | Thread id.                                                                     |
| processlist\_id | Processlist id for foreground threads, or NULL for background threads.         |
